Nick's Unnamed Bauble Mod
=========================


Ideas I'm stealling
-------------------

Protection Amulets, made from ChromaticCraft Crystal Amulet. These give the Combinded effects of that Crystal Amulet at level II, and it's neighboring colors, at level I.

A Ring that add damange on each successive hit? 

A Ring that feeds you food from your inventory.

A Ring that when you are Mining, Swaps the tool you are using if a tool more approprate to that materal is in your inventory.

A set of Baubles that each give one bonus heart. But as more items from the set are worn the larger the bonus is.

A Magnetic Ring, stealing parts from Botina's and some from baublelicious Mod. Maybe adding a Rotoarycraft machine to disable it, along with having it interfear with AC engines.
