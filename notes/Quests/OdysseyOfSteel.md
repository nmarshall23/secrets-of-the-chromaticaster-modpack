Odyssey of Steel
================
For you to survive you are going to need stronger tools.
However this might take you to depths you never imagined.



A Furnace to Smelt with
-----------------------

Collect plenty of stones to craft 4 compressed cobblestone. Then craft a Furnace.

Tasks:
 1. Collect Cobblestone
 2. Craft 4 Compressed Cobblestone
 3. Craft a Furnace


Hammer Time
-----------
Stone hammers are the first in a long line of Mining Hammers. Hammers will break a 3 by 3 group of blocks. They also place a torch from anywhere in your inventory, when you right click.

Tasks:
 1. Craft a Stone Hammer

Bronze Hammer
-------------
This Bronze hammer will serve you well. It is far stronger then Stone.

Iron Hammer
-----------
An Iron Hammer is even stronger then Bronze. While Bronze is more receptive to enchantments.

Nickel Hammer
-------------
Nickel is less durable then Iron but far more then Bronze.
It's enchantability exceeds Bronze and Iron, but is less then Gold, Platinum and magically enhanced materials.


Steel Hammer
------------
Steel has excellent durability. Only Platinum and Tools fortified with Diamond exceeds it.
However Steel has poor receptivity to enchantments.


HSLA Steel Hammer
-----------------
HSLA Steel is a strengthened variant of Steel. However it does less damage then steel.




Collect gravel
--------------
Wood will splinter, and Stone is heavy. Flint is a superior material to make tools from.
You can find Flint in gravel. Or you can craft three gavel into one flint.



Tasks:
 1. Collect 27 Gravel
 2. Have 9 Flint


Flint Tools
-----------
Flint can harvest more items then wood. You will need it to harvest Tin and Copper.

Tasks:
 1. Craft Flint tools.


Tin
---
Tin is most used as a component of machines. Tin can be found around height 60, ±12 meters, in long narrow veins, centered around a Mother lode of ore.

Tasks:
 1. Collect 3 Tin Ore.


Copper
------
Copper can be used to craft tools that will last much longer then Flint tools. Copper Ore is found around height 48, ±16 meters, in long narrow veins, centered around a Mother lode of ore.

Tasks:
 1. Collect 9 Copper ore.


Aluminum Ore
------------

Aluminum is another metal used mostly in building machines. The stone furnace does a poor job of smelting Aluminum. Other means of extracting this ore will yield more ingots. You will find Aluminum Ore around height 94, ±34 meters. Medium mother lodes with 2-4 horizontal veins.

Tasks:
 1. Collect 3 Aluminum ore.





Engineering your Future
-----------------------

An Engineer's Hammer is used to crush ores into dust. It is also used to complete some multiblock structures. Perhaps you should consult the manual.


Tasks:
 1. Craft an Engineer's Hammer


Coke Oven
---------
A Coke oven is used to make Coal Coke, and Creosote Oil. Coal Coke will burn for twice as long as Coal. Creosote Oil is used to treat wood.

To Build the Coke Oven, place 27 of the Coke Bricks in a 3x3x4 cube then right-click one of the sides' center block with an Engineer's Hammer. Refer to the Engineer's Manual for more information.  

Tasks:
 1. Craft Coke Bricks


Time to use that education ( making bronze)
--------------------------


Bronze Tools
------------
Bronze Tools far more durable then Flint and Stone Tools. They have the same enchantability as Copper Tools, but are faster and deal more damage.

Tasks:
 1. Craft Bronze Pickaxe

Gold
----
You will find Gold Ore around height 16, ±16 meters. Small mother lodes with 2-4 long narrow horizontal veins. Rarer and shorter than iron veins.

Redstone
--------
You will find RedStone Ore in Isolated vertical veins, starting at height 64-70 and running straight downward for about 35 blocks. Fairly common, 3x more common in Deserts Biomes.

Iron
----
You will find Iron Ore around height 32, ±32 meters. Large mother lodes with 2-4 long narrow horizontal veins.



Magnetite Ore
-------------
Lodestone are found by mining Magnetite Ore. Lodestones have a weak magnetic field.
Then are used to craft Redstone Flux generators and other machines.


Iron Tools
----------
Iron Tools are more durable then Bronze. While Bronze is more receptive to enchantments.


Diving into the Abyss
---------------------

To make bricks that can withstand intense heat. You will need to dive the the bottom the an ocean. There you will find round geodes of dark stone.


Mortar for the bricks
---------------------

Tasks:
 1. Mine sulfer
 2. Mix Bryntienere Morter


Crude Blast Furnace
-------------------
The Crude Blast Furnace is used to make steel.
To form a Blast Furnace arrange 27 Blast Bricks in a 3x3x3 cube, and right-click one of the side's center blocks with the Engineer's Hammer. Refer to the Engineer's Manual for more information.


Steel Tools
-----------
Steel has excellent durability. Only Platinum and Tools fortified with Diamond exceeds it.
However Steel has poor receptivity to enchantments.


Platinum Tools
--------------
