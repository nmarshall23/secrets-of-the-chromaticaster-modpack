Odyssey of Steel
================
For you to survive you are going to need stronger tools.
However this might take you to depths you never imagined.

A Furnace to Smelt with
-----------------------

Tasks:
 1. Collect Cobblestone
 2. Craft 4 Compressed Cobblestone
 3. Craft a Furnace


Hammer Time
-----------
Stone hammers are the first in a long line of Mining Hammers. Hammers will break a 3 by 3 group of blocks. They also place a torch from anywhere in your inventory, when you right click.

Tasks:
 1. Craft a Stone Hammer


Collect gravel
--------------
Wood will spinter and break, Stone heavy and slow. Flint is a superior material to make tools from.
You can find Flint in gravel. Or you can craft three gavel into one flint.

Tasks:
 1. Collect 27 Gravel
 2. Have 9 Flint


Flint Tools
-----------
Flint can harvest more items then wood. You will need it to harvest Tin and Copper.

Tasks:
 1. Craft Flint tools.


Tin
---
Tin is most used as a component of machines.  
Tin can be found around height 60, in long narrow veins, centered around a Motherlode of ore.

Tasks:
 1. Collect 3 Tin Ore.


Copper
------
Copper can be used to craft tools that will last much longer then Flint tools.

Copper, Motherlodes with groups of long narrow veins found around height 48.

Tasks:
 1. Collect 9 Copper ore.


Aluminum
--------
Aluminum is another metal used mostly in building machines. The stone furnace does a poor job of smelting Aluminum. Other means of extracting this ore will yield more ingots.

Aluminum Ore, Medium motherlodes with 2-4 horizontal veins each. Found around height 94.

Tasks:
 1. Collect 3 Aluminum ore.





Engineering your Future
-----------------------



Tasks:
 1. Craft an Engineer's Hammer


Coke Oven
---------

Time to use that education ( making bronze)
--------------------------


Bronze Tools
------------

Tasks:
 1. Craft Bronze Pickaxe

Gold
----

Gold Ore, Motherlodes with groups of long narrow veins found around height 20. Rarer and shorter than iron veins.
3x more common in temperate hardwood Forest biomes (Forest, Forest Hills, Birch Forest*, Autumn Woods*, Forested Island*, Forested Hills*, Rainforest*, and Woodlands*).

Redstone
--------
RedStone Ore, Isolated veins (no motherlodes) starting at height 64-70 and running straight downward for about 35 blocks. Fairly common, but challenging to mine because the player must tunnel vertically.
3x more common in Deserts, Desert Hills, and Mountainous Desert*.

Iron
----

Iron, Motherlodes with groups of long narrow veins found around height 43.
3x more common in cold biomes (Taigas, Taiga Hills, Ice Plains, Ice Mountains, Alpine*, Glacier*, Ice Wasteland*, Mountain Taiga*, Snow Forest*, and Tundra*).









To make bronze you will need to first craft an Engineer's Hammer.

To make dusts, place an Ore Block with your Engineer's Hammer in the crafting grid.

Bronze dust is made from 3 copper dust and 1 tin dust.


Mortar for the bricks
---------------------

Tasks:
 1. Mine sulfer
 2. Mix Bryntienere Morter
