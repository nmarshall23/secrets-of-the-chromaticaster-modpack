Forgotten Magic - Thaumcraft
============================
Discover the foundations of magic


Folly of the Thaumaturgist
--------------------------
Unlike intuitive magic like Chromaticraft. Thaumaturgy requires, you to scan items to learn their magic properties.
Explore the world and examining blocks, items and creatures with a Thaumometer.
You will initially not be able to examine all objects since you have not discovered their component aspects. For example, an object containing the Lux aspect can only be examined if you have previously discovered the Lux aspect, or know the two aspects that combine to create it.

Tasks:
 1. Craft a Thaumometer


Arcane Table
------------
Depice being made from Great wood, this table doesn't anything on it's own. It is used as a base for other surfaces useful in the practice of Thaumaturgy.

Scribing Tools
--------------
Your study of Thaumaturgy will require you to research. Place two Arcane Tables next to each other, then use scribing tools on one to create a Research Table. The Research Table will show you all the aspects you have discovered, also you can combine two aspects to a compound aspect. Not all compinations of aspects are valid. Read your Thaumonomicon to learn more.


Arcane Worktable
----------------
To create an Arcane Worktable simply right-click with a wand on a table you have placed in the world. The Arcane Worktable serves the same purpose as a normal crafting table, with a few key exceptions.


Iron Capped Wand
----------------
A crude wand, but it is all that you can create at this time. If you ever need another Thaumonomicon, you must simply use your wand on a bookshelf placed in the world.


Gold Banded GreatWood Wand
--------------------------


Deconstruction Table
--------------------
There comes a point in any thaumaturge's career where he is unable to progress with research due to his lack of knowledge.
One possible recourse is the Deconstruction Table. The table allows you to break down objects into their simplest parts which you can examine.


Goggles of Revealing
--------------------
Building on the basic principles of the Thaumometer, you have begun refining its ability to detect magic into something more... revealing.
