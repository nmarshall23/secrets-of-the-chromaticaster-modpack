# Common Ores

Many mods make use of ores that they don't themselves provide, mainly because they assume others do.  Some good examples would be copper, tin, and silver.  This is done through ore dictionary entries that apply as soon as something appropriate is available.

However, what if you don't want to use Thermal Expansion, Tinker's Construct, or any other of a number of heavy tech mods?  That's where Common Ores comes in.

Common Ores creates and places the most common ores, and adds recipes for the ingots, blocks, tools and armor made from those metals.  And since these metals are oredicted as expected, they will show up in other mods' crafting recipes.  The ores included with this mod are Copper, Tin, Aluminum, Nickel, Silver, Platinum, and Lead.  This mod also includes the alloys Electrum (gold + silver) and Bronze (Copper + Tin)

To get the most from this mod, it is recommended you also use the Vanilla Ingot Works mod, as that mod will allow you to smelt the alloys available from this mod.
