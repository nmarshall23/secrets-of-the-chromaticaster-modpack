Description
===========

This is a Minecraft Modpack. There is a light theme, and quest if you choose to enage it. 

It is still in early Alpha. 

Features: 

* An increased difficulty.
  * Food matters no longer is hunger a mild annoyance.
  * Mob's have a few new tricks
* A customised Tool Progression
* Unified recipes across Mods as much as is practial with respect to the Mod author's vision


I took inspration from ModPacks like Regrowth and Material Energy 4.

Licensing
=========

Content I have created is licensed under the MIT License.
This covers the modtweaker scripts, any lore text, configuration customizations, and Quests.

However that License does give anyone permission to distribute a compete build of the pack. You will need to check each mod's distribution licensing.


Also the art assets in `/common/resources/customitems/textures/items/` and in the `jmod-project/sotc.jmod/assets/sotc.jmod/textures` where copied from included mods. I had to create custom items, often because a mod coded that item in a clever but incompatable way. Or because I needed that item not to be a subtype. 

<FIXME> List each art file, and the licensing that mod uses.
